Automated CI/CD Pipeline
Description
Built an automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and Docker, which reduced deployment time by 50% and increased deployment reliability. This project demonstrates how to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying a Node.js application.

Key Features
Automated build, test, and deployment pipeline using Jenkins.
Containerized application with Docker for consistent environments.
Deployable to cloud platforms like AWS for scalability and reliability.

Technologies Used :
-Jenkins: To automate the CI/CD process.
-Docker: For containerization of the application.
How It Works
The CI/CD pipeline automates the following stages:

Build: Fetches the latest code and installs dependencies.
Test: Runs application tests to ensure stability.
Containerization: Builds a Docker image of the application.
Deploy: Pushes the container to a cloud or runs it locally.
Setup and Usage
Prerequisites
Jenkins installed or hosted on a server.
Docker installed locally or on the deployment server.
A Node.js application to automate.
Steps to Reproduce
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automated-ci-cd-pipeline.git
cd automated-ci-cd-pipeline
Set up Jenkins:

Install required plugins (e.g., Git, Docker Pipeline).
Create a new pipeline job and link it to this repository.
Use the provided Jenkinsfile for pipeline configuration.
Build and run the Docker container:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t automated-ci-cd-pipeline .
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 automated-ci-cd-pipeline
Access the application:

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.
Future Improvements
Integrate with GitHub Actions for a fully cloud-based CI/CD pipeline.
Add more comprehensive test coverage for the application.
Deploy to a cloud-native platform like AWS ECS or Kubernetes.
